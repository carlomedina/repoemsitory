why don't we pretend 
to be creative and pensive.
surely, there are other things
to commit and to push;
and, in moments of doubts,
to revert or to rebase.
regardless, they are 
always hashed out.

forget it or fork it,
fair forewarning, 
warranty: not included.
your issues will 
likely never be mine,
yet your requests 
always welcome.

let's review our days
cherry-picked or verbose.
either way, thrilled that
you'd tag along


git add .
git commit -m "feat: init commit"
git push -u origin main
